The SCCM PowerShell module version 2.0 contains today 63 cmdlets for managing the SCCM 2007 infrastructure whith PowerShell (through WMI).

Since WMI is still the underlying technology used by SCCM 2012, a great part of the cmdlets (or logic) can be re-used for SCCM 2012 management.

The module is provided "AS IS".
